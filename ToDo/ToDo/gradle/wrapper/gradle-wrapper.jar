The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a binary file that is generated by the Gradle build system and cannot be manually created or edited. It is typically included in the project when you set up the Gradle wrapper. Therefore, this file is intentionally left blank as it should be generated by the Gradle wrapper setup process.
